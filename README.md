### **About The Project** 💡

Traditional portfolios are static documents that fail to engage or adapt to different audiences. As a Lead Machine Learning Engineer with 3+ years of experience building production AI systems, I wanted to create something that reflects the technology I work with daily.

This **AI-Native Portfolio** transforms the typical "About Me" page into an **intelligent, conversational experience**. Instead of making recruiters and collaborators scroll through endless text, it invites them to ask questions and receive personalized, context-aware answers.

Whether you're a recruiter evaluating my experience, a technical lead assessing my skills, or a fellow engineer interested in collaboration—this portfolio adapts to **you**.

**Key Innovation:** Built by an ML Engineer for ML Engineers, this portfolio demonstrates practical AI implementation while showcasing my professional journey.

### **Features** ✨

*   **🗣️ Interactive AI Avatar:** Engage in real-time conversation powered by advanced LLMs. Ask about my voice AI systems, LLM optimization work, or Northwestern esports achievements.
*   **🧠 Context-Aware Intelligence:** The AI understands who it's talking to—whether discussing HIPAA-compliant systems with healthcare recruiters or RAG optimization with ML engineers.
*   **🎨 Modern, Responsive UI:** Built with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion for smooth animations and professional presentation.
*   **🚀 Production-Ready Architecture:** Demonstrates the same engineering principles I apply to production ML systems—scalable, maintainable, and performant.
*   **💬 Natural Conversation:** No rigid forms or static pages—just natural dialogue about my 3+ years building AI systems at scale.
*   **📊 Dynamic Content:** Showcases 12+ AI/ML projects with live previews, from voice AI to computer vision.

### **What Makes This Portfolio Different** 🌟

As someone who's:
- Built **voice AI systems** serving 1000s of customers daily with sub-second latency
- **Optimized LLMs** to reduce costs from $300 to $40/day
- **Saved $300K+** through automated RAG evaluation pipelines
- Led **production ML infrastructure** on AWS (SageMaker, Bedrock, EC2)

...I wanted my portfolio to reflect the same level of technical sophistication I bring to my work.

This isn't just a portfolio—it's a **demonstration of AI engineering principles** in action.
